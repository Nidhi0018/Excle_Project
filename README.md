# Excel Data Cleaning Project ‚Äì Sales Dataset Standardization

## üìå Objective
This project simulates a **real-world business scenario** where raw sales data collected from regional teams is inconsistent, messy, and not analysis-ready. Using Excel, I performed full data cleaning and standardization to ensure it's ready for downstream tasks like reporting, dashboarding, and decision-making.

## üß© Business Problem
Raw datasets often contain:
- Duplicate entries causing inflated metrics
- Inconsistent region and gender labels that break reports
- Messy formatting that complicates integration with tools like Power BI
- Missing calculations (like Total Sales Value)

In a real company, this would lead to **incorrect KPIs, misinformed decisions, and lost trust in data**. My job here was to fix that.
